# Composer Studio

Composer Studio is Atama's business-friendly interface where marketers can create experiences based on the business capabilities defined in [Composer Core](../composer-core/README.md).

If you're new to Composer, the [guides](../getting-started/README.md#getting-started) are a good place to start.

Otherwise, feel free to browse the **user manual** for more detailed information about specific features.
