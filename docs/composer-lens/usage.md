# Usage

Our usage graph shows you a live view of your providers, source capabilities, business capabilities, and bundles.

1. Navigate to the "organization" view.
2. Select "Usage" from the main navigation.
3. Use the filters at the top to narrow down what you're interested in.
    1. Metrics
        1. "Connection only" - With this selection, the thickness of the line does not have any meaning except that the very thin line means that there's not yet a mapping.
    2. View
        1. "Show only mapped" - Include only source capabilities that have been used (mapped) in at least one business capability.
        2. "Show only unmapped" - Include only source capabilities that have NOT yet been used (mapped) in a business capability. This can be helpful to figure out gaps in your Atama setup or indicate data models that should be cleaned up in the source systems.
