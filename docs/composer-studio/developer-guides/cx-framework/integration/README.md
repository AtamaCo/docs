# Integration

An integration in the context of our CX Framework describes the "glue-code" that composes a [fetcher](../fetcher/README.md) and a [renderer](../renderer/README.md). It's based on the specific patterns of the platform or framework we're integrating with.

## Existing Integrations

* [Next.js](./nextjs.md)
* [Shopify Hydrogen](./hydrogen.md)

:::info

We're always looking for new frameworks to integrate with. Please [contact us](https://www.atama.co/contact-us) if you are one of the following:

* a technology vendor that wants to integrate with Atama
* interested in working with Atama but don't see the frameworks you use listed here yet
